# Architectural Decision Records

## What are Architectural Decision Records?

> An architecture decision record is a short text file in a format similar to an Alexandrian pattern. (Though the decisions themselves are not necessarily patterns, they share the characteristic balancing of forces.) Each record describes a set of forces and a single decision in response to those forces. Note that the decision is the central piece here, so specific forces may appear in multiple ADRs. - Think Relevance Blog - [Documenting Architecture Decisions](https://web.archive.org/web/20190119090933/http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)
